My workplace generously allowed me to take some personal-leave time after a rough & tumble start to 2017. I'll use the time to go Fully Concentrated on learning to program, something I've been exploring very-part-time for about a year.

<a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/962/640/658.png" target="_blank">That seems fine</a>. Except, oh wait, why?

No one who looked into my humanities-riddled education would likely suggest I take up computer programming as a natural fit. But spending the last few years in tech, I’ve come to a conclusion about myself:

I want to learn. Every day. Just for learning’s sake. And when I started down the ‘hobbyist coder’ road, it quickly became clear that the exceptionally popular notion of “learning to code” is packaged in a misleading way, suggesting that first you learn to code, then you code. Done. 

The delightful surprise when you start to unpack the reality of programming is that you'll never, ever stop learning to code. Instead let's put it this way, dear reader: to code is to learn.

The developers and engineers I know are continuously learning new technologies and new approaches. They’re always onboarding new skills. They're getting better because they’re digging into new depths of technical detail and broadening their overarching conceptual horizons. Their learning is in alignment with their workplace’s goals. Even the mistakes are <a href="https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/" target="_blank">culturally positioned</a> as a chance to grow. There’s some serious, serious inquiry going on here. 

And suddenly the field of computer science doesn’t seem so far removed from my much-loved undergraduate degree in philosophy. It's a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, applicable and socially valued. There’s craft, there's abstraction and conceptual argument, there is opinion, expertise, and an ever expanding realm of skills to acquire and lessons to learn. To me this is a sure-fire formula for one overriding emotion: Let me at it, plz.

In this blog, I expect to swing pretty wildly between the minutiae of my technical learnings to the art of learning itself. (That’s another hangover from my philosophy days: go meta or go home.) Lucky for me, there are free resources and guides all over the internet that will help frame both.

I’ll talk about the technical resources I’ll be leaning on as I build projects. I’m a big believer in trying to max out what you can learn for free, so hopefully I can provide a sense of how possible it is to DIY a coding education rather than enrolling in a formal bootcamp.

I'll also (sorry) wax philosophical and humanitastic, because that's me. For the more philosophically-minded, if you *ever* needed a Learn to Code Spirit Guide, look no further than Robert Pirsig in <a href="https://archive.org/details/ZenAndTheArtOfMotorcycleRepair-RobertPirsig" target="_blank">Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a>. The gently meandering story provides ground for a lengthy reflection on the joy of free inquiry into the workings of technology. No surprise then that he has a million fitting quotations for the programming n00b. I'm sure he'll be oft-quoted here, and as a general opener to my own period of self-study, I couldn’t ask for a better sentiment than this:

"We’re living in topsy-turvy times, and I think that what causes the topsy-turvy feeling is inadequacy of old forms of thought to deal with new experiences. I’ve heard it said that the only real learning results from hang-ups, where instead of expanding the branches of what you already know, you have to stop and drift laterally for a while until you come across something that allows you to expand the roots of what you already know. Everyone's familiar with that. I think the same thing occurs with whole civilizations when expansion’s needed at the roots.”

One last warning: You'll probably get to know me best through my strong desire to randomly link you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UrKcfh43zM" target="_blank">my favorite internet gems</a>. So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AhZFUFyyiI" target="_blank">for like, no reason</a>, a nod to <a href="https://www.waitbutwhy.com" target="_blank">this post's namesake</a>.

So that's it. Except to say: Hello, world. <!--POOP!-->

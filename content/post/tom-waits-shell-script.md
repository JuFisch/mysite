Today I got sad because I thought I understood something about $GOPATH and $PATH variables, so I spent a bunch of time trying to articulate it in writing, and then discovered in the process that I didn't really understand it correctly. So that's a whole morning spent on something that didn't really pan out.

I wanted to accomplish something. Preferably in 30 seconds or less.

So I wrote a tiny shell script that opens YouTube with a pre-filled search query for Tom Waits:

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

open https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tom+waits</code></pre>

Now I can open my Terminal and type "tom" for a soul-cleansing flood of whiskey references, glitter-tossing and gritty mumbling. Other than my own.

Thanks, Tom.

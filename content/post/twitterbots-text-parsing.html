It's been quite a while since I've posted. A few weeks ago I switched to a new type of Go project after feeling powerlessly furious at most of the goings on in the Trump adminstration. I was so enraged by the Presidentâ€™s response to fascist ideology that I had to do something to defuse my own rage.<br><br> 

Since I  worry about Trump's tweet-based approach to policy and his 140-character limit on morality, I decided I'd like to chop Hannah Arendt's text "The Origins of Totalitarianism" into tweetable pieces. Just to put it into the Twittersphere to stand there in opposition to the garbage the President sees fit to spew into it.<br><br>

I'd like to broaden the scope of this project a bit and create a library / instructions for other people who might like to do something similar with other books you'd like to see the President engage with. Orwell's "1984" is also available in full text online, for instance.<br><br>

I'm still working on an impossible-to-get-my-head-around problem finding footnotes embedded within the text, so for the sake of saving time, I'll link to the repo <a href="https://github.com/JuFisch/twitter" target="_blank">here</a> rather than share code snippets. Suffice it to say: footnotes, I used to love you, but now you are dead to me.<br><br>

Stay tuned!

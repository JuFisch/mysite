      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m forging ahead with Pushie, my real-time push notification server. The first step was setting up Gorilla Mux to handle routing. Each route then has an associated handler function, which, when called, executes one of Pushie&amp;rsquo;s main functions.
I decided to start by working out PublishHandler, the function called when a web app sends a request to pushie at the URL path &amp;ldquo;/publish.&amp;rdquo; Guess what it does? It publishes a message from the web app to any clients listening on that channel.</description>

      <description>This is a big deal for me: I had my first pull request merged! Confession: it was a Docs fix, but hey, I was still celebrating.
It&amp;rsquo;s a tiny 6 line diff, adding a step to Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Contributor Guide. (Hugo is an awesome blog generator written in Go, and it&amp;rsquo;s also powering this blog. I love working with it, so I started hunting around their repos for an opportunity to make a contribution.</description>

      <description>Today I got sad because I thought I understood something about $GOPATH and $PATH variables, so I spent a bunch of time trying to articulate it in writing, and then discovered in the process that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand it correctly. So that&amp;rsquo;s a whole morning spent on something that didn&amp;rsquo;t really pan out.
I wanted to accomplish something. Preferably in 30 seconds or less.
So I wrote a tiny shell script that opens YouTube with a pre-filled search query for Tom Waits:</description>

      <title>Creating a Push Notification Server: Overview</title>

      <description>My first portfolio project is a real-time push notification server, written in Golang. It&amp;rsquo;s modeled on the Node.js project by Beejeebus. And as luck would have it, I&amp;rsquo;m married to Beejeebus! (Yay!) So while this is probably more of an advanced project, I have a live-in mentor and occassional responsive rubber duck kindly supporting me on this one.
Basic Concept
To get started, I had to understand what exactly Pushie does and how it works.</description>

      <description>My workplace generously allowed me to take some personal-leave time after a rough &amp;amp; tumble start to 2017. I&amp;rsquo;ll use the time to go Fully Concentrated on learning to program, something I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring very-part-time for about a year.
That seems fine. Except, oh wait, why?
No one who looked into my humanities-riddled education would likely suggest I take up computer programming as a natural fit. But spending the last few years in tech, Iâ€™ve come to a conclusion about myself:</description>

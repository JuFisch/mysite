        <p>I&rsquo;m forging ahead with Pushie, my real-time push notification server. The first step was setting up Gorilla Mux to handle routing. Each route then has an associated handler function, which, when called, executes one of Pushie&rsquo;s main functions.</p>

<p>I decided to start by working out PublishHandler, the function called when a web app sends a request to pushie at the URL path &ldquo;/publish.&rdquo; Guess what it does? It publishes a message from the web app to any clients listening on that channel. I thought I would just blow through each handler function one by one until Pushie was complete. But once I <em>really</em> got into the weeds of how each function worked, I discovered that a better second step to &ldquo;just jump in with development&rdquo; was &ldquo;just jump in with tests that will help guide your development.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ok, ok, in actual fact, I&rsquo;m incredibly stubborn. I was initially <em>very</em> hesitant to stop the clear forge-ahead work of jamming through each handler function. Writing tests!? More work instead of less!? Surely that&rsquo;s going to slow me down and be fruitless. Thankfully, someone wiser than me encouraged me to get over my stubborn gut-instinct, and oh how right that person was!</p>

<p>Writing tests alongside your main code provides you with something akin to a built-in sounding board. You must enumerate your goals in the test, and the test will - if written well - let you know if your code is meeting those goals or not. I like to think that if I was attacking the code without tests, I would do so by taking a systematic, step-by-step approach to what any given function needs to do. But instead of simply trusting that I&rsquo;ll do this, I can do my step-by-step thinking through of functionality &ldquo;out loud&rdquo; in the test file instead.</p>

<p>Testing also sets up a natural barrier for something I&rsquo;ve discussed before: the need to &lsquo;fake&rsquo; things that your code will eventually have access to - a hardcoded hash instead of something generated dynamically, or a web request I&rsquo;ve written by hand rather than one sent by an actual web app. Establishing a test file gives you a natural place to store all these items. You can &lsquo;fake the world&rsquo; in your test, so your code is much more aligned with the truth of what it will actually need to be. Then, you can slowly chip away at those &lsquo;fake&rsquo; things in your test, or move away from the test paradigm at all and simply run your code in the final environment you&rsquo;re anticipating&hellip; if you&rsquo;ve been testing well, the switch from running tests to running live should be far more of a table-cloth trick maneuver than a mess of broken dishes and dropped cutlery.</p>

<p>Using the test tools included in Go&rsquo;s standard library has been delightful and very easy. I thought I would give a quick rundown here.</p>

<p><b>Go&rsquo;s Package &ldquo;Testing&rdquo;</b></p>

<p>Go automates a lot of the testing machinery in its &ldquo;Testing&rdquo; package. The setup is incredibly simple: just create a file with name ending in &ldquo;_test.go&rdquo; and put it in the same package being tested (i.e. if your Go code is in package main, open your _test.go file with package main as well). Then import the &ldquo;testing&rdquo; package. Now you can use a particular function signature to test functions in your main code. That signature looks like:</p>

<pre><code>func TestXxx(*testing.T)</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of how these things pair up from Pushie. This is a bit of code from Pushie.go, my main project file. The relevant details here are: I&rsquo;m in package main, and I&rsquo;m working on a function called PublishHandler.</p>

<pre><code>package main

...

func PublishHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
...
}</code></pre>

<p>My test file is named Pushie_test.go, following the &ldquo;_test.go&rdquo; convention. It&rsquo;s in the <em>same</em> package as my code to test (package main), and I&rsquo;ve named a testing function TestPublishHandler to communicate with PublishHandler, again following the Testing package&rsquo;s convention:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
  ...
  "testing"
  ...
)

...

func TestPublishHandler(t *testing.T) {

...

}</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! Now the code inside TestPublishHandler can be implemented to test PublishHandler. Remember the function signature of PublishHandler above? That tells me at some point I&rsquo;ll have to create an http.ResponseWriter and an *http.Request pointer, and then pass those to PublishHandler inside TestPublishHandler. Whee.</p>

<p><b>Migrating Fakes to Tests</b></p>

<p>When I first started, I was &lsquo;faking&rsquo; or &lsquo;mocking up&rsquo; a bunch of hard-coded things like hashes of Pushie&rsquo;s channels and sockets, pretend socket objects, and an example message, because PublishHandler will eventually need to refer to those things but I didn&rsquo;t have them implemented yet (most of that info comes from the Web App, which doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.) As mentioned above, one of the nice things about testing is that I can move all my &lsquo;fakes&rsquo; or examples into the test file. It provides an obvious and useful way to keep my code organized: get Pushie.go running just as it would in the live production scenario, and keep fake-out data in the test file.</p>

<p>Another reason this is helpful is that you can more rigorously use your tests to <em>test</em> because you can change some of the hardcoded data values you&rsquo;re passing. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve hardcoded something to pass a value of &ldquo;1.&rdquo; You <em>expect</em> it to be the same if you pass it &ldquo;-1,&rdquo; but instead of futzing with your code file, you can alter some of the values in the test file to check those assumptions.  by changing some of those hard-coded items. In Pushie&rsquo;s case, the fake message now lives in my test file. I can run the test to make sure the message sent by my test request is the same one mirrored back to me by Pushie in it&rsquo;s response, and then I can change the text of the message and run my test again to make sure changing messages don&rsquo;t break my Pushie code.</p>

<p><b>fmt.Println Is Your Friend</b></p>

<p>The Go compiler offers a lot of helpful (let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;helpful;&rdquo; sometimes it makes you want to scream, but ultimately it is helpful) information when you&rsquo;ve got something wrong in your code. Even so, I&rsquo;ve found there&rsquo;s no substitute for adding debugging information to your code and printing it to the screen so you can follow along with the action. I used to code this way in Ruby and Javascript and it&rsquo;s just so informative when you&rsquo;re looking for issues.</p>

<p>In Go, that command is fmt.Println (this is akin to console.log in javascript or puts in Ruby). I use fmt.Println <em>all</em> the time - just remember to import &ldquo;fmt&rdquo;. At one point I was printing out the full story of what was going on in Pushie, and all of the variable values, just so I could walk through my terminal output and get a feel for what was happening and why something wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p>The same holds true when you have tests set up: I just output that much more extra info from Pushie_test.go as I worked from failing to passing tests. I&rsquo;m not sure this is a good practice or not, but I started indicating where the printed line was coming from to make it easier to follow along. Any fmt.Println statements in my main code began &ldquo;Pushie.go says:&rdquo; and those in the test files were labeled &ldquo;Pushie_test.go says:&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>State of Pushie Update</b></p>

<p>So what is Pushie actually able to do now? Not tons, honestly. But I&rsquo;m excited to have a good clean test for PublishHandler that passes. I want to walk through the code a bit here.
Here&rsquo;s a peek inside PublishHandler:</p>

<pre><code>func PublishHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {

    decoder := json.NewDecoder(req.Body)
    for {
        var m Message
        if err := decoder.Decode(&m); err == io.EOF {
            break
        } else if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
        // Get sockets for the channel from channelsHash.

        sockets := ChannelLookup(channelsHash, m.Channel)

        // Count the number of sockets listening.
        sentCount := len(sockets)

        // Build a response object.

        responseObject := PublishResponse{
            NumSent: sentCount,
            MesSent: m.Data,
        }

        // Marshal the response object into a byte slice of JSON data.
        responseByte, err := json.Marshal(responseObject)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("error:", err)
        }

        //fmt.Println("This is the response as bytes: ", responseByte)

        // For socket in sockets
        for _, socket := range sockets {

            // To be replaced with socket.Send
            fmt.Println("Sending to socket ", socket)
            // Check for error (which disrupts sentCount)
        }

        // Send response to web app.
        w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8")
        w.Write(responseByte)
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>Right now, I have PublishMessage build two pieces of information into its response (alongside the basic Content-Type header): the message text that was sent (m.Data) and the <em>number</em> of sockets that it sent the message to (sentCount).</p>

<p>Warning: There&rsquo;s a big cheat here, which I&rsquo;m going to have to come back to later. Right now, sentCount is just set equal to len(sockets), the length of the list of socket objects stored as a value to the name of the channel (the key) in the channels hash. So basically, channels hash says &ldquo;Hey there are three sockets in this channel&rdquo; and PublishHandler says &ldquo;Ok, sentCount equals three!&rdquo; Why is that cheating? Because sentCount doesn&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> count the number of sends. (Heyo!) When this is complete, sentCount will truly be a counter of the for loop that iterates through each socket and calls socket.Send. That way, if I try to send a message to Socket #2 of 5, and I get an error back, I can (a) return an error (b) use sentCount to show that it wasn&rsquo;t equal to the socket number in the channels hash, i.e. that it failed to send the message to the correct number of sockets.</p>

<p>But I digress. Let&rsquo;s focus on the fact that PublishHandler sends a response including number of sockets it sent to and the message content. That let&rsquo;s me implement a test of PublishHandler that says &ldquo;Make sure that we hear a response from PublishHandler that says it returned the # of sockets we know is in the channel, and the text of the message we asked it to send.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I get to that &ldquo;make sure&rdquo; step with Pushie_test.go:</p>

<pre><code>func TestPublishHandler(t *testing.T) {

    var Socket1 = Websocket{
        id: 1,
    }

    var Socket2 = Websocket{
        id: 2,
    }

    var Socket3 = Websocket{
        id: 3,
    }

    fmt.Println("running TestRoutes")

    // Set up body with message.
    message := Message{
        Channel: "bunno",
        Data: map[string]interface{}{
            "message": map[string]string{"text": "oh POOP", "username": "jufisch"},
        },
    }

    // This pulls out the content of the example message and sets them as variables named for our *expected* response content.
    expectedResMesText := message.Data["message"].(map[string]string)["text"]
    expectedResMesUser := message.Data["message"].(map[string]string)["username"]

    // Encode message to messagebytes ([]byte).
    mbytes, _ := json.Marshal(message)
    //fmt.Println(mbytes)
    //message_bytes := []byte(`{"blah": "blah"}`)
    mbuffer := bytes.NewBuffer(mbytes)

    // Set up the request with the path and the message.
    req, err := http.NewRequest("POST", "/publish", mbuffer)
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal()
    }

    // Set up the channels hash.
    channelsHash["bunno"] = []Websocket{Socket1, Socket2, Socket3}
    channelsHash["quadrupal"] = []Websocket{Socket1, Socket2, Socket3}
    channelsHash["thisisfine"] = []Websocket{}

    // Create a recorder to pass in as our ResponseWriter.
    rr := httptest.NewRecorder()

    PublishHandler(rr, req)

    // Create a response object to store the unmarshaled JSON from response received.
    var res PublishResponse

    // Unmarshal the json from responseRecorder into var res
    err = json.Unmarshal(rr.Body.Bytes(), &res)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("error:", err)
    }

    // Assign number of sockets in called channel to socketsInChannel.
    socketsInChannel := len(channelsHash[message.Channel])

    // Assert that the number of socket.Send calls in the response is equal to # of sockets in appopriate channelHash channel.
    assert.Equal(t, res.NumSent, socketsInChannel, "These should be equal ints.")

    // Assert that responseObject.MesSent == message.Data

    
    // Get the message text out of the response.
    resMesText := res.MesSent["message"].(map[string]interface{})["text"]
    // Get the message username out of the response.
    resMesUser := res.MesSent["message"].(map[string]interface{})["username"]

    //Assert that the message content (text and username) is equal in original message & message mirrored in response.
    assert.Equal(t, expectedResMesText, resMesText, "These should be equal message text values.")
    assert.Equal(t, expectedResMesUser, resMesUser, "These shoudl be equal message username values.")
}</code></pre>

<p>Ok! I learned a ton while setting this up. It&rsquo;s important to note that I&rsquo;m using two additional testing packages for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Package <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest/" target="_blank">"httptest"</a>, a test suite for Go's http package in the Go standard library</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify" target="_blank">Testify</a>, a toolkit for testing that works well with Go's standard library</li>
</ul>

<p>The TestPublishHandler function creates some socket objects and a message object, the example content I was talking about earlier. It also assigns values into the channelsHash map, which populates the main channelsHash variable in Pushie.go for Pushie to refer to.</p>

<p>Then it creates a &ldquo;NewRecoder,&rdquo; which is a handy item from the httptest suite. The recorder can be passed into an http handler func that&rsquo;s looking for an http.ResponseWriter. The recorder simply stores (or records) whatever response is being written by PublishHandler&rsquo;s response writer, without truly <em>being</em> a response writer. We also create the second argument to be passed to PublishHandler, an http.Request object. What is the request that will trigger the PublishHandler function? Right! A POST request sent to the URL path &ldquo;/publish.&rdquo; Huzzah!</p>

<p>Once we have those things contstructed and established, we&rsquo;re ready to call PublishHandler, but we want to implement the logic of the test. I use Testify&rsquo;s &ldquo;assert.Equal&rdquo; method to make sure that what I expect in the test suite is what I get back (i.e. is equal) from Pushie&rsquo;s response (remember, this will eventually come from a true ResponseWriter, but right now the response is stored in my Recorder). I have three assert.Equal statements, checking that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pushie sent a message to the correct number of sockets</li>
  <li>Pushie's response message data included the correct message text</li>
  <li>Pushie's response message data included the correct message username</li>
</ol>

<p><br>
Whew. One thing you might be wondering: why do I check both message text and message username, instead of simply checking all the message data stored in the hash at one time? To be honest, this is a bit of a hack, because I was getting a slight mismatch of the type of message data between PublishHandler and TestPublishHandler (one was a map[string]interface{} and one was a map[string]string, so even though they had the same inner content, which is what we care about, the type was different and caused the tests to fail.)</p>

<p>So that, in what would never even remotely fit inside a nutshell, is what I&rsquo;ve been working on this week.</p>

<p><b>TL;DR</b></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m now able to pass a test request and response recorder to PublishHandler, and ensure that the JSON data comes back correctly! Yay!</p>

<p>One handler function down, about 13 to go ;)</p>
